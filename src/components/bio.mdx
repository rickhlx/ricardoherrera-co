This is my personal website. I'm a Site Reliability Engineer living in Patterson, NY. I use this website to jot down ideas and share some of the things I'm working on. I also use this site to test out new techniques and tools for automation and other SREish things. When I'm not in front of a computer writing code, you'll find me playing around with cameras. I mainly share my work on [my Instagram](https://instagram.com/rickhlx) so give me a follow!

This personal site is inspired by [Joel Hook's digital garden](https://joelhooks.com). I love the idea of having a space to hoard information I want to share, and nurturing posts over time.

If you'd like to get in touch feel free to [email](mailto:rickhl@outlook.com) me!
