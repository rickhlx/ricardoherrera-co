This is my very first blog post. I really don't know what I'll talk about
here. But I hope it's useful to someone out there.

I've been having lots of fun learning about front-end web development
lately. Using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) and React has been very eye opening. I can now
truly say I **hate** CSS.

Over time this site may look different. But this first blog post will stay the same.
I have no idea how long this will be here.
