Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ricardo Herrera. I'm a computer systems engineer located in Patterson, NY.

This is my personal site which I use to learn about web development as well as test out tools and techniques. I'm passionate about DevOps, specifically Infrastructure as Code and GitOps methodologies. 

This personal site is inspired by [Joel Hook's digital garden](https://joelhooks.com).
